description: Use to implement an approved plan. Dispatches the up:implementer agent per phase on Sonnet 4.6. Runs plan-diff check and consistency sweep after each phase. Forbids silent fallbacks and mutation of external spec/design docs. Dispatches the planner skill when deviations invalidate the plan.
---

# Execute

Implement the approved `## Plan` from `docs/tasks/<slug>.md`. You are the dispatcher — each phase is handed to a fresh `up:implementer` subagent. After each phase returns, you run the plan-diff check and consistency pass before moving on. The goal is a working change that honors Design and Plan.

## Before starting

<required>
1. Read the full task file — Design, Invariants (IV), Principles (PC), Assumptions (AS), Unknowns (UK), Plan. Plan is not optional reading.
2. Scan the plan for ambiguity, missing dependencies, or contradictory steps. Raise now, not after writing half the code.
3. Verify branch + worktree. Check `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and `git branch --show-current` match the task file's `**Branch:**` and `**Worktree:**` headers. If mismatched: stop and ask.
4. Build the checklist — one todo per plan phase (or per task if phases are coarse). Use TodoWrite.
</required>

## Brevity

<required>
Before writing anything into the task file (deviations, hands-off decisions, known risks), read `plugins/up/skills/_brevity.md`. Apply its five principles. Specifically:
- `### Deviations from plan` — create the subsection only when a deviation happens. Do not add an empty "no deviations" line.
- `### Hands-off decisions` — when every stage auto-approved with no interventions, collapse to a single entry `- all stages auto-approved, no interventions`. When a stage did intervene (reviewer fix, deferral, etc.), keep its own entry.
- `### Deferred (needs user input)` — one line per deferral, with the concrete artifact the user needs (file path / command / question).
The Exception clause still holds: deviations, deferrals, and known risks always carry evidence and "why".
</required>

## Branch / worktree correctness

<system-reminder>
Editing the wrong repository is one of the most common bugs. Before any write, confirm:

- `pwd` matches the task file's `**Worktree:**` (or the main repo if `none`)
- `git branch --show-current` matches `**Branch:**`

When you dispatch a subagent (`up:explorer`, `up:researcher`), pass the intended working directory explicitly in the prompt. Subagents do not inherit your `cwd` reliably across harnesses.
</system-reminder>

## Per-wave loop

If the plan contains a `### Interface graph` subsection (declared by `up:uplan`), derive execution waves via topo-sort over `->` arrows: source phases (no `Consumes` side) form wave 1; wave N+1 is the set of phases whose every consumed IF is produced by phases in waves 1..N. Otherwise fall back to the serial one-phase-at-a-time loop (IV6).

**Serial fallback (no `### Interface graph`):** execute phases in order, one at a time.

**Wave iteration:**

<required>
Before dispatching a wave:
1. Collect the `@` paths declared by every phase in the wave.
2. Verify pairwise disjointness: no path may appear in more than one phase of the same wave. On overlap, stop execution and log under `### Deferred (needs user input)` with the conflicting paths and phase names. Do not dispatch the wave (PC4, IV2).
</required>

For each phase (serial fallback) or wave (parallel):

<required>
1. Mark the phase(s) `in_progress` in TodoWrite.
2. Dispatch implementer(s) — see "Wave dispatch" below for waves; see "Dispatch per phase" for serial fallback.
3. On implementer return, handle status:
   - `DONE` → continue to step 4.
   - `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` → read the concerns. Resolve or record them, then continue.
   - `NEEDS_CONTEXT` → supply missing context, re-dispatch.
   - `BLOCKED` → diagnose. If the plan is wrong, invoke `up:uplan`. If context-only, re-dispatch. Do not retry identically.
4. **Plan-diff check.** Read the phase's commit (`git show <sha>`). For every plan bullet in this phase: is it reflected in the diff? For every change in the diff: is it covered by a bullet, or by a deviation the implementer reported? Any unreported structural gap → record as a deviation, or re-dispatch with correction.
5. **Consistency pass.** If the implementer tightened a rule, renamed a symbol, or changed a pattern in one spot, grep the diff and the wider repo for the same pattern. Apply the same change everywhere. If the implementer already did this (their self-review requires it), confirm and move on. If they missed siblings, either re-dispatch or fix inline and amend.
6. Mark the phase `completed`.
</required>

Parallelism comes only from the Plan's `### Interface graph` via the wave scheduler; never infer waves at runtime (IV4, PC5).

## Dispatch per phase

Each phase runs in a fresh `up:implementer` subagent (Sonnet 4.6). You (the dispatcher, on Opus) coordinate.

<required>
**Pass in the dispatch prompt:**
- Full verbatim text of the phase from `## Plan` (e.g. PH3)
- `### Invariants` (IV), `### Principles` (PC), `### Assumptions` (AS) from `## Design`
- TDD decision (from Design — `yes` or `no (reason)`)
- Absolute working directory (subagents do not inherit `cwd` reliably across harnesses)
- Expected git branch (from task file `**Branch:**` header)
- `Commit mode: self | defer` — `self` for solo-phase or serial-fallback dispatch; `defer` when the phase is in a multi-phase wave per `### Interface graph`
- `Owns: <paths>` — verbatim from the phase's `@` list in `### Interface graph` (IF3)
- `Implements: <IFs>` — IFs on the right side of the phase's `->` arrow (IF3)
- `Consumes: <IFs>` — IFs on the left side of the phase's `->` arrow (IF3)

**Do not pass:**
- Session history or prior-phase chatter
- The full task file (pass only the sections above)
- Later phases (keep the implementer scoped to one phase)
- Rationale behind design decisions — the plan is the contract
</required>

**When to skip dispatch and do it inline:**
- Trivial phase (typo, one-line import fix, changelog edit)
- Phase needs mid-work interactive user input
- A phase-N-and-N+1 fix follows from review findings, small enough to just edit

## Wave dispatch

Used when the Plan declares `### Interface graph` (written by `up:uplan`). Waves are derived by topo-sort — never hand-declared (PC5).

**Reading the graph:**
Parse each line of the form `PH<N>  <consumes-CSV> -> <produces-CSV>   @ <paths-CSV>`. Empty left of `->` = source (no consumed IFs). Empty right = sink. Collect Owns (`@`), Consumes (left), Produces (right) per phase.

**Wave derivation:**
- Wave 1: all phases with no Consumes.
- Wave N+1: all phases whose every Consumes IF is produced by phases in waves 1..N.
- Repeat until all phases are assigned.

**Disjointness check:**
Before dispatching a wave, verify that the `@` sets of all phases in that wave are pairwise disjoint. On overlap: halt, log the conflicting paths under `### Deferred (needs user input)`, do not dispatch.

**Dispatching a wave:**
Fire one `up:implementer` per phase in the wave as concurrent `Agent` tool calls in a single response (AS1). Pass `commit: defer` to each (AS3 — only the dispatcher touches git in defer mode). Include `Owns`, `Implements`, `Consumes` from the graph line (IF3).

**Serialized commit protocol:**
After all `Agent` calls in the response return, process successful implementers in ascending PH order:

<required>
For each phase whose implementer returned `DONE` or `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`:
1. `git add <paths staged by the implementer>`.
2. `git commit -m "<proposed message from implementer report>"`.
3. **Boundary check (IF5):** run `git show <sha> --name-only`. Every changed path must be a member of the phase's declared `@` set. On trespass: halt the wave, log under `### Deferred (needs user input)` with the trespassed path and phase, then either re-dispatch with tightened scope or escalate to `up:uplan`.
4. Plan-diff check: every plan bullet reflected in the diff? every diff change covered?
5. Consistency pass: grep for sibling patterns; apply missing changes if any.
</required>

Only after all successful phases are committed, handle failures.

**Failure handling:**
- On `BLOCKED` or `NEEDS_CONTEXT` from one phase: do not abort sibling phases mid-work. Wait for all siblings to return, commit their successful results per the protocol above, then diagnose the failure — re-dispatch with corrected context, invoke `up:uplan` if the plan is wrong, or stop and log under `### Deferred (needs user input)` (PC4).
- A failure in one phase never rolls back a sibling's already-committed work.

## Wiring check

Runs once, after the final wave's phases commit (IF6).

<required>
For each `IF<n>` declared in the Plan's `### Interfaces`:
1. Identify the IF's named symbol or anchor (the identifier named in the IF's signature bullet).
2. Grep the repo for callers or references of that symbol.
3. For code IFs: verify each call site matches the declared signature.
4. For doc IFs (non-code IFs where the "signature" is a section anchor or declared public contract of a SKILL.md): grep for the declared anchor or reference and verify it resolves.
5. On mismatch: log under `## Conclusion → ### Deviations from plan` with `IF<n>: <mismatch description>`. Decide whether to re-dispatch the offending phase (implementation error), invoke `up:uplan` (plan declared the wrong signature), or continue with a recorded deviation.
</required>

## TDD

If Design recorded `TDD: yes`, invoke `up:test-driven-development` for each unit under test:

- Write the failing test, watch it fail for the right reason
- Write the minimal implementation to pass
- Refactor with tests green
- Commit

If `TDD: no`, skip the test-first loop; verification happens in `up:uverify`.

## When to dispatch `up:explorer`

- The implementer reported `NEEDS_CONTEXT` and a code map would unblock them
- You need a call graph or execution path beyond what a quick Grep gives
- You need a ranked list of essential files for a feature

Dispatch with tight scope and pass the working directory explicitly. Don't over-use — inline Grep/Read beats a subagent for one-shot lookups.

## Consistency pass — when changing a pattern, sweep for others

<required>
Any time you (or the implementer) change how code handles a pattern — tightening a fallback, renaming a symbol, adding a guard, flipping a default — grep the diff and the wider repo for the same pattern. Skim `git log -p` for the commit that introduced it, in case siblings were added the same way. Apply the change everywhere in the same commit.

The reviewer's job is to catch what you missed. Your job is to minimize what you miss.
</required>

<good-example>
Implementer made `compute_at_k_cursor_l2` raise on empty input to honor "no silent fallbacks". Before the commit lands, grep the diff for sibling metrics (`cursor_l2@L`, `click_f1@L`, `cursor_std_*`) and tighten those the same way, or flag them as deferred with justification.
</good-example>

<bad-example>
Fix one spot, commit, reviewer finds four more siblings, two rounds of fixups, noisier history, tighter-in-some-places-not-others inconsistency in the file.
</bad-example>

## Don't modify upstream specs or external design docs

<required>
The plan is the contract. External spec files (e.g. anything under `docs/specs/`) are inputs — read-only during execute. If the implementer finds the spec is wrong, they report it and stop. You (the dispatcher) surface it to the user. The user decides whether to update the spec, revise the plan, or continue with a deviation.

Never edit the plan inline to hide a deviation. Never silently edit an external spec. Deviations live in the task file's `## Conclusion → Deviations from plan` section.
</required>

## Forbidden: inventing fallbacks, defaults, or best-effort behavior

<system-reminder>
No silent fallbacks. No invented defaults. No "best effort" try/except that swallows the error. If you're tempted to write `.get("attr", 0)` and zero is not a genuine, intended default — don't. Crash > corrupt state.

Never add `try: ... except: pass`. Never catch a broad exception to "keep going". Never substitute a placeholder value so the code "works for now".

If the plan is silent on what to do when X is missing, the answer is: let it raise. Then tell the user this is a potential failure point and add it to the task file's `## Conclusion` as a known risk.
</system-reminder>

<bad-example>
```python
# Plan said nothing about missing config. Agent "helpfully" defaults.
timeout = config.get("timeout", 30)
user_id = payload.get("user_id", "anonymous")
```

This hides real bugs. "anonymous" user_ids leak into downstream systems. 30s timeouts mask misconfigured services.
</bad-example>

<good-example>
```python
# Rigid. If it breaks, it breaks loudly.
timeout = config["timeout"]
user_id = payload["user_id"]
```

Then append to the task file's `## Conclusion` under "Known risks":
> `- config["timeout"] will KeyError if config is partial. Plan didn't specify a default; recommend either adding one with user approval, or validating config at load time.`
</good-example>

Raise these potential failure points with the user immediately, not after execute completes.

## Deviations from plan

A deviation is any structural change from what the plan says. File moved to a different location, method signature different, phase ordering swapped, a phase cut, a phase added.

<required>
When a deviation happens:

1. Do not edit the Plan inline. The plan is the contract that was approved; it stays as-is for the review.
2. Record the deviation in the task file's `## Conclusion` under a `### Deviations from plan` subsection (create if missing). Format: `- <what changed> — <why>`. If no deviation happens, do not create the subsection at all — per `_brevity.md`, empty subsections are deleted, not written.
3. If the deviation is minor (renamed a helper, swapped two steps) — continue execution.
4. If the deviation is structural enough that later phases in the plan no longer apply — stop executing. Invoke `up:uplan` with enough context (what was done, what no longer applies, what new reality is). Let the planner skill update the plan before resuming.
</required>

<good-example>
"Phase 3 planned a new `CacheBackend` class. During phase 2 I discovered an existing `cache/backend.py` with a usable interface. Extending it is simpler.

Appended to `## Conclusion`:
> - Phase 3: used existing `cache.backend.CacheBackend` instead of creating a new one.

Continuing to phase 4 — later phases are unaffected."
</good-example>

<bad-example>
Agent edits `## Plan` inline with `<!-- deviation: ... -->` comments. Reviewer now can't tell what the plan *was*, only what it became. Plan-alignment check is compromised.
</bad-example>

## When to stop and ask

- A plan instruction is ambiguous or self-contradictory
- A dependency the plan assumes is missing
- A test fails in a way that suggests the plan is wrong (not just the implementation)
- Verify would obviously fail even after you finish
- You're about to invent a fallback / default / catch-all

Don't force through. Ask. This list applies in both interactive and hands-off modes — it defines the "genuinely impossible without user input" exception. Log each such stop under `## Conclusion → ### Deferred (needs user input)` in hands-off mode.

## Hands-off mode

See `up:handsoff` for the full contract, including the safety principles (worktree-first, no destructive git ops, no push to remote, additive-over-subtractive edits). Stage-specific delta: execute's own behavior is unchanged — the existing fail-fast rules and "when to stop and ask" list above *are* the hands-off handling. Each such stop is logged under `### Deferred (needs user input)` with enough context for the user to resume.

Never invent a default to keep moving. Conservative = fewer assumptions = stop and log.

## Never

- Start on `main`/`master` without explicit user consent if the plan specified a branch
- Skip the commit between phases
- Claim complete without running what you built
- Push to remote without explicit user consent
- Edit the Plan section to hide a deviation
- Edit an upstream spec file during execute (flag issues, don't mutate)
- Invent a silent fallback to avoid stopping
- Commit without running the plan-diff check and consistency pass

## Terminal state

All phases done and committed → invoke `up:uverify`. Do not skip to review. Do not finish the branch yourself.
