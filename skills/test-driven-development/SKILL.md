# Test-Driven Development

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass. Refactor. Repeat.

**Core principle:** if you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

## When TDD applies

TDD applies when **all three** hold:
1. The code produces specific outputs for specific inputs (deterministic I/O contract)
2. It is called from more than one place (library code, API method, utility, validator)
3. A regression here would warrant a CI red light

## When to skip TDD

Skip when any of these hold:
- Training a model, hyperparam tuning, anything stochastic with no "correct" output
- Exploratory data analysis (you're figuring out what's in the data)
- One-off scripts or throwaway prototypes
- Research / experiment code
- UI changes where the real test is "does it look right"

The TDD decision is made during `up:design` and recorded in the task file as `TDD: yes` or `TDD: no (reason)`.

## Iron law (when TDD applies)

**No production code without a failing test first.**

Code before test? Delete it. Start over from the test. Don't "adapt" what you wrote.

## Red → Green → Refactor

### 1. RED — write a failing test

- One behavior per test
- Clear name describing the behavior
- Real code path where possible; mocks only when genuinely unavoidable

```python
def test_retry_succeeds_after_two_failures():
    attempts = 0
    def op():
        nonlocal attempts
        attempts += 1
        if attempts < 3:
            raise RuntimeError("fail")
        return "success"
    assert retry(op, max_attempts=3) == "success"
    assert attempts == 3
```

### 2. Verify RED — run it, watch it fail

**Mandatory.** Confirm:
- It fails (doesn't error with an import/syntax issue)
- The failure reason is "feature missing", not a typo
- The error message is what you expected

Test passes immediately? You're testing behavior that already exists. Fix the test.

### 3. GREEN — minimal code to pass

```python
def retry(op, max_attempts):
    for i in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            return op()
        except Exception:
            if i == max_attempts - 1:
                raise
    raise RuntimeError("unreachable")
```

Don't add features, options, or "while I'm here" changes. Just pass the test.

### 4. Verify GREEN — run it, watch it pass

Confirm the new test passes and no existing tests broke.

### 5. REFACTOR

Clean up: names, duplication, extract helpers. Keep tests green. Don't add behavior in this step.

### 6. Next test

Loop back to RED for the next behavior.

## Good tests

- **Minimal** — one behavior per test. If "and" appears in the name, split.
- **Clear** — name describes what it checks.
- **Real** — exercise actual code, not mocks pretending to be code.

## Red flags — stop and start over

- You wrote code before the test
- A test passes immediately on first run
- You can't explain why a test failed the way it did
- You're keeping code "as reference" while writing tests — delete it
- You're "adapting" existing code while writing tests — that's tests-after, not TDD

## Why order matters

Tests-after answer: *what does this do?*
Tests-first answer: *what should this do?*

They are not the same. Tests-after are biased by the implementation you already wrote. Tests-first force edge-case discovery before you commit to a design.

## When stuck

- **Don't know how to test** — write the wished-for API in the test first, let it drive the implementation shape
- **Test is too complicated** — the interface is too complicated; simplify it
- **Must mock everything** — the code is too coupled; use dependency injection
- **Huge setup** — extract helpers; if it stays huge, the design is wrong

## For bug fixes

Write a failing test that reproduces the bug. Then follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR. The test proves the fix and prevents regression.

## Final rule

```
Production code → a test exists and was written first and failed first
Otherwise → not TDD
```
