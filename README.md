# ultrapack

A lean, opinionated Claude Code skill pack for spec-driven, git-centered development. Internal name: `up`. Invocations always use the `up:` prefix (`up:design`, `/up:make`, `up:reviewer`).

## Philosophy

- **One task, one file.** Every task produces a single markdown file at `docs/tasks/<slug>.md`, evolved through Design → Plan → Conclusion.
- **Lean plans.** Concrete locations, per-file change bullets, interface signatures. Snippets only where words fail.
- **Git-centered.** Branch per non-trivial task, worktrees for parallel work, commits are the timeline, task files live in the repo.
- **Invariants-first.** Discovered in design, obeyed in plan, verified during review.
- **Subagent independence.** Reviewers run in fresh contexts, never see change rationale.
- **TDD where it fits.** Deterministic, reusable code only. Not for training runs, EDA, one-offs, or research.
- **Manual testing mandatory.** Agent must run what it built before claiming done.
- **Minimalistic.** Fewest words, fewest commands, fewest skills that still cover the workflow.
- **Fail fast, fail loud.** No silent fallbacks.

## Install

Install via a local plugin marketplace symlink.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/ultrapack ~/Documents/ultrapack
ln -s ~/Documents/ultrapack ~/.claude/plugin-marketplace/up
```

Add an entry to `~/.claude/plugin-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "up",
  "description": "ultrapack — lean, opinionated skill pack for spec-driven, git-centered development",
  "source": "./up"
}
```

Then in Claude Code: `/plugin install up@local-plugins` and `/reload-plugins`. Verify with `/up:make` or by listing skills.

To pick up edits mid-session (the symlink means files are live on disk), just run `/reload-plugins` — no reinstall needed.

## Contents

### Skills (11)

- `up:design` — Brainstorm requirements and approach; populate Design + Invariants + Principles.
- `up:uplan` — Lean plan: files, line numbers, class/method/interface names, invariants, test strategy.
- `up:execute` — Implement the plan, incremental commits, dispatch `up:explorer` when needed.
- `up:verify` — Checklist of what should and shouldn't hold, smoke test, loop back on failure.
- `up:review` — Dispatch `up:reviewer`, fill Conclusion with outcomes and deviations.
- `up:document` — Guidance for docs, CLAUDE.md, READMEs, and in-code comments.
- `up:debug` — Four-phase root-cause investigation; no fixes without reproduction.
- `up:test-driven-development` — RED → GREEN → REFACTOR, only when the task qualifies.
- `up:data-engineering` — Sequential stages, idempotent/atomic/retriable, pre-flight checks.
- `up:ml-experiments` — Overfit one batch, check for leaks, scale-up gated.
- `up:git-worktrees` — Smart directory selection, safety verification.

### Commands (5)

- `/up:make` — Orchestrate the full flow: slug → task file → design → branch → plan → execute → verify → review.
- `/up:try` — One positive + one negative check; run and report.
- `/up:step-back` — Circuit breaker: stop, diagnose why approaches failed, propose new direction.
- `/up:handoff` — Session-summary for continuation.
- `/up:reflect` — Reflect on dialogue, extract learnings into CLAUDE.md / memory / docs.

### Agents (4)

- `up:explorer` (Haiku 4.5) — Codebase tracing, file:line refs, essential-files list.
- `up:implementer` (Sonnet 4.6) — One phase of a plan: code + tests + commit + self-review. Dispatched per-phase from `up:execute`. Fresh context, no session history.
- `up:reviewer` (Sonnet 4.6) — Single-dispatch, plan-alignment-first, confidence-filtered, severity-tiered.
- `up:researcher` (Sonnet 4.6) — General-purpose: decompose query and systematically investigate.
